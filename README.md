# CLOUD-AND-FINGERPRINT-BASED-LICENSE-AUTHENTICATION-SYSTEM
This project provides the design method of fingerprint based driving license authentication system. The system includes fingerprint sensor, fingerprint matching and verification process, wireless transmission, Google Firebase (Cloud). The current system involves manual verification of license which is difficult to monitor. The issues of forgery of licenses by some people are a serious issue from the security point of view. The issues regarding the fake identity have been raised. In order to overcome such problems and to achieve the simple and high real-time system, I have made a low-cost and high-performance wireless driving license verification model, which provides a new wireless driving license system which will be helpful for traffic police and RTOs.
